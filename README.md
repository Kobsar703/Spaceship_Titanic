# Spaceship_Titanic
Analysis of dataset Spaceship Titanic dataset from Kaggle 

I tried several iteration on the dataset and for current state we have score 0.79144
and place in a queueu is 1456. That is in the python jupyter notebook
of second iteration (2iter)

After I applied Random Forest to continuous data, in the 4th iteration 
I get best score 0.79284 with the place 1319.

Played with parameters in Grid Search which led to place 1222 with best score
0.79424.

Applied Random Forest and OnVSRest classification and used all values
from the dataset but best score was not improved for this try. Should try different model
approach or consider extra feature.
